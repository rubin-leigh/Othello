USER INSTRUCTIONS:
So far, the game is fully functioning and only lets the player make legal moves on
the board.  However, one trouble I have come across is determining whenever the player
no longer has a move available to make.  I believe I made a method that does this
correctly, but it takes so long to execute that the program is difficult to use with
this delay.  I need to find a more efficient algorithm to determine this so the program
can run as it is intended to.
